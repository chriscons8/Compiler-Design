# Compiler-Design
Property of CMPE Department for San Jose State University. This repository is a tutorial for SJSU students taking compiler design and learn the foundation of the basic functionalities for compilers. The purpose of this tutorial is create to create a guide on how to install the ANTLR tool. Specifically, **ANTLR 4.7.2**. In addition, this tutorial will have cross compatibility between operating systems such as Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. This creates ease of accessibility between students and teachers as well as continual updates as assignments become more complex. **It is important for each individual to have ANTLR installed in their system to contribute equally.**

# Installing WSL  for Windows
For individuals who choose to operate in a Linux or a Mac system, you may skip this step. There are multiple tutorials and guides on the internet on how to install WSL.
Here is a reference on how to install WSL for windows:

# Setting up Operating System for Software Development
## 1) Please aknowledge the amount of hard drive space needed when installing tools, IDE's , or Virtual Boxes. The space required for creating the compiler design workspace will take 4GB at most. It is important to have hard drive space allocated. 
## 2) Please make sure that you have the repository downloaded.

Open up the file explorer in the current directory by typing ```explorer.exe .```

Drag and drop the following files from the repository. **Make sure the files are droped into your home directory in WSL or you will get an error.**

Type the following command: ```sudo bash setup.sh``` 

Your shell should be now setup for software development and ANTLR should be succesfully installed.
